# Exploring Mushrooms
When asked to think of a mushroom, you might imagine the following:

It's a beige, convex mushroom top with a uniform, thick stem. Maybe you thought of it cut up on a slice of delicious pizza or braised with sauce over rice. Regardless, you most likely did not consider this:

Mushrooms exist in a variety of different colors, shapes, sizes, textures, etc. In this project, I will analyze an extensive mushroom dataset from [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom) using bar charts and acquaint myself with the diverse array of mushrooms that exist worldwide.
